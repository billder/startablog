It’s a rainy rainy day.

Today is a rainy day and I forgot how to write. Power lines are knocked down in neighborhoods all the way around us. Streets are filled with potholes and closed roads. Heavy winds continue the chaos. And I forgot how to write. 

Our backyard was mostly spared from all disaster. The retaining wall still retains the wall. It just feels like a day of nasty heavy rain. Nasty wet rain, but no damage found anywhere. We’re lucky.

I forgot how to write. 

Feels like stretching words out of my brain, pulling them out and onto the screen, but this is a good exercise.
